# EE599-Project-Gesture-Classification-using-Capacitive-Sensor-Array
Gesture Classification using Flexible Capactive Sensor Array, Arduino Nano BLE board, MPR121, and TinyML: Course project - EE599 Flexible and Stretchable Bioelectronics

1. Colab Notebook (Tensorflow) - This folder has the jupyter notebook that can be used to train a ML model and convert it to a suitable format that can be loaded onto the arduino
2. Gesture Detection Arduino - This folder contains arduino code that runs inference on the Nano BLE microncontroller
3. Sample dataset used - contains .csv files that can be used to train the models
4. Sample models - contains some of the models that we tried (difference in activation function, number of layers). These can be directly used with the arduino code for inference
5. Sensor layout files - contains the layout files of the flexible capacitive sensor array that was developed
